# ActionGame
This repo contains the code of a game that I have been developing for 6 months now

Links for some of the code that I believe is more important.

1.[Particle Factory classes](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/AbstractFactory/Particles)<br>
2.[Player controller scripts](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Player)<br>
3.[Player Actions. Actions separate some logic from the movement controller script. Actions make the player fly, swimm, halt, glide, etc](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Player/Actions)<br>
4.[Collectables - Scripts that handle collecting coins, gems, start etc](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Collectables)<br>
5.[Enemies - Scripts that control the behaviour of different enemies](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Enemies)<br>

7.[Bosses - Scripts that handle boss behaviours](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Boss)<br>
