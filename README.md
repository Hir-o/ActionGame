# ActionGame
This repo contains the code of a game that I have been developing for 6 months now

Links for some of the code that I believe is more important.

[Particle Factory classes](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/AbstractFactory/Particles)<br>
[Player controller scripts](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Player)<br>
