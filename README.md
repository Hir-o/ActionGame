# ActionGame
This repo contains the code of a game that I have been developing for 6 months now

Some of the code that I believe is more important than others.

[Particle Factory classes](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/AbstractFactory/Particles)
[Player controller scripts](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Player)
[Player Actions. Actions separate some logic from the movement controller script. Actions make the player fly, swimm, halt, glide, etc](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Player/Actions)
[Collectables - Scripts that handle collecting coins, gems, start etc](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Collectables)
[Enemies - Scripts that control the behaviour of different enemies](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Enemies)
[Singletons](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Singletons)
[Bosses - Scripts that handle boss behaviours](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Boss)
[Managers - Scripts that manage different game functions](https://github.com/Hir-o/ActionGame/tree/main/Scripts/Managers)
